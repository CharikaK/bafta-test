There are many ways of encoding and decoding. 

 
mbstring (multibyte strings)
utf8_encode
htmlspecialchars
base64_encode and base64_decode
urlencode
str_rot13(), base64_encode(), and gzinflate are mainly for security for site contents

I presume that you have given me the original massages as you have mentioned "how they might be encoded".
The task does not say the media of this message. 
If I go for php Multibyte String functions, Multibyte character encoding schemes were developed to express more than 256 characters in the regular bytewise coding system.
mbstring is designed to handle Unicode-based encodings such as UTF-8 and UCS-2 and many single-byte encodings for convenience

utf8_encode can be used if this is an HTML content and required to convert the string from ISO-8859-1 to UTF-8. And if the messages are nested string of arrays too.

htmlspecialchars is not relevane for this task as this masseges do not have any special HTML characters. Again I am assuming that the given peice of string is not encoded. 

base64_encode and base64_decode again to deal with HTML contents. Still we can use this way if the contents are on HTML medium, or email containt.

str_rot13() can be used to both encode and decode. Again this is more to do with website content.

gzdeflate() & gzinflate() is also good for security and this is better for website content.
